# SQL_practice_and_notes
Notes and projects from the Codeacademy course. Codeacademy Pro is free for 3 months (at least one good thing came of this pandemkc). I'm using at least some of this time to learn sequel, from queries to data visualization. 

Note: this course and all this code is in sqlite, but most of the syntax in other SQL langauges is very similar.
